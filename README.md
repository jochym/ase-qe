ASE Calculator for Quantum Espresso
-----------------------------------

This is a fork of the QE-Forge project for the interface to ASE.
The idea is to follow the ASE guidelines as close as possible and
implement it as a FileIOCalculator class. 

The starting point is a output parser from the parent package 
with my own parsers written for my own research. I hope to make it 
fairly complete at least for a generic tasks.
